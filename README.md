Play minesweeper versus your friends. Log in with your google account to get features like leaderboards, spectating and multiplayer

## Work on it yourself

1. Clone the project with the following command, or fork your own: <br>
```git clone https://github.com/Olaussen/minesweeper-online.git``` <br>

2. After cloning. Be sure to have either *npm* and/or *yarn* installed. I use *yarn* for this project, but *npm* will also work. Install the needed dependencies with either of the following command(s):  <br>
```yarn``` ```yarn install``` ```npm install```

3. Run the project in a development environment with either of the following command(s): <br>
```yarn start``` ```npm start```<br>
This will automatically open the application at http://localhost:3000/
